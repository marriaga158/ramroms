# ramroms

Node utility to store unzipped ROMs (and any other ZIP archive for that matter) into a RAM disk so that you don't have to have both the zipped and unzipped copies of ROMs sitting around wasting space.

Currently only designed for Windows. You MUST have imdisk installed AND in your path for this to work!

This uses the Z: drive letter by default, and attempts to format it as part of disk creation. If you for some reason have a Z drive this will probably wipe that.

If someone wants to create versions for other OSes, feel free. If there's enough interest, I might make it. Idk.

If you need to contact me, I'm kelp6063 on Discord and marriaga158 on Twitter.
